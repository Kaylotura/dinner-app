# dinner-app
A JavaScript web-app that assists a user to prepare and make dinner.
At the top of the page is a textbox where a user may enter ingredients to
search for what possible dinners they can make.
Entering ingredients with spaces will render 10 recipes that have
the given ingredients, while commas will filter the recipes listed by the
first ingredient.
Because this app uses a semantic search, it can also be used for searching
dishes by name. For example, while denim is not an ingredient in any of the
dishes, a search for the word 'pants' returns 10 different dishes, each with
pants in the title.
